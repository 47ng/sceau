  Code signing for NPM packages
</p>

## Installation

Using your favourite package manager:

```
pnpm add -D sceau
yarn add -D sceau
npm install -D sceau
```

## Usage

First off, you'll need a signature private key.

### Keygen

You can generate one from the CLI:

```
$ sceau keygen

Run the following command in your terminal to use this private key:

export SCEAU_PRIVATE_KEY="0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"

Associated public key:
0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

This will give you an environment variable definition for the private key,
and the associated public key.

> **Note about keys:**
> The underlying signature is Ed25519, which stores the public key as part of
> the private key.
>
> If you misplace your public key, it can be obtained from the private key:
> the public key is the **LAST half** (64 hex characters) of the private key.

### Signing packages

To sign a package, run the following command:

```
$ sceau sign
```

This will:

1. Collect a list of files to be published (based on the `files` option in package.json and the .npmignore file)
2. Hash and sign each file into a manifest
3. Inject some metadata, like:

- The current time
- A permalink to the sources _(see [CI usage](#ci-usage))_
- A permalink to the build process _(see [CI usage](#ci-usage))_

4. Sign the whole thing
5. Store it in a `sceau.json` file next to package.json

#### CI usage

Links to source and build process are injected to provide transparency and
traceability to a package being built.

The idea is that the signing step would occur in a public CI/CD context.

You can specify the URLs to the sources and build process either via the command-line,
or via environment variables:

| CLI argument | Environment variable | Description                    |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `--source`   | `SCEAU_SOURCE_URL`   | Permalink to the source code   |
| `--build`    | `SCEAU_BUILD_URL`    | Permalink to the build process |

If those are not provided, sceau will still sign your package, but the URLs
will be set to `unknown://local`.

Sceau will write to a file, but will also print to the standard output, so this
signature process can be audited by third parties.

#### Setting up package.json

Because sceau should run right before NPM packs your artifacts to publish them,
you should run the signature step in the `prepack` script:

```jsonc
{
  "files": [
    // ...
    "sceau.json"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "prepack": "sceau sign"
  }
}
```

Note that it's also required to add `sceau.json` to the list of files, otherwise
the signature would be left behind when your package is packed.

#### Options

`--packageDir` lets you specify a path to a pacakge to sign.
By default, sceau will try to look for a package to sign at the current working
directory.

`--file` lets you choose the output file (defaults to `sceau.json`). It should
be a path relative to the package directory (where package.json is located).

Example:

```
$ sceau sign --packageDir packages/my-package --file build/signature.json
```

This will sign package `<cwd>/packages/my-package`, and store the output at
`<cwd>/packages/my-package/build/signature.json`.

### Verifying

You can verify a package signed with sceau using the following command:

```
$ sceau verify --packageDir path/to/package
```

#### Options

You should provide the public key to verify a signature against, obtained from
a trusted source (ideally one not under GitHub's or NPM's control, in case those
were to be compromised).

```
$ sceau verify --publicKey 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

If the package uses a non-standard `<packageDir>/sceau.json` signature file,
you can specify its location (relative to the package directory):

```
$ sceau verify --file build/signature.json
```

## About the name

_Sceau_ is French for _seal_ (the ones found on letters, not in oceans).

It's pronounced like _so_.
